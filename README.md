# Multivariate\_anomaly\_detection

Industrial Process Anomaly Detection & Recommendation System
Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection with Graph Autoencoder

A next-generation anomaly detection system for industrial or multivariate time-series processes. This system detects abnormal patterns across correlated variables and provides actionable insights through feature attribution and anomaly scoring.

## The Idea: Beyond Single-Feature Detection

Traditional anomaly detection evaluates each variable individually, often missing complex inter-variable relationships.
Our system uses a **Graph Autoencoder** to model correlations between features as edges, capturing which interactions contribute most to anomalies.

Instead of relying solely on thresholds, the model evaluates relationships across all variables, providing **accurate anomaly scoring (0‚Äì100%)** and highlighting the top contributing features.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multivariate Anomaly Detection:** Detects abnormal patterns across multiple correlated process variables.
* **Graph Autoencoder Model:** Models relationships between features using edges and correlation strength.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring of anomaly score, top contributing features, and recommended actions. Includes a gauge visualization.
* **Feature Attribution:** Highlights the features responsible for anomalies using reconstruction error.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Core Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `torch_geometric`, `scikit-learn`, `plotly`, `streamlit`
* **Backend Model:** Graph Autoencoder (correlation-based edges, reconstruction error for anomaly scoring)
* **Preprocessing:** Timestamp validation, missing value handling, data normalization
* **Visualization:** Interactive dashboard with gauge/speedometer for anomaly score
